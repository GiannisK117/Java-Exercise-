Through the creation of the BlackPanther class and its implementation in the Main class, I have further advanced my proficiency in Java by exploring Randomization and Method Overloading. I learned how to use the Random class to simulate dynamic behaviors, such as the searchFood method, where different probabilities determine the success of an action. I also mastered Constructor Overloading, creating multiple ways to initialize a BlackPanther object based on available data, and practiced using the this keyword to resolve naming conflicts between parameters and instance fields. Additionally, I improved my skills in Object Interaction, developing a breed method that compares the state of two different objects to determine a result. Finally, I practiced writing complex Conditional Logic and data comparison algorithms to analyze object attributes—such as weight and age—across an array of instances, while using getData() methods to retrieve a comprehensive summary of an object's current state.
